## Warning

This plugin can only run on servers using the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.org/) core, it does not support other cores!

---

## Introduction

ISeeYou can use the Replay API provided by the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.org/) core to record every move of the player in `.mcpr` format.

### Features

- **Automatic recording**: No manual operation is required, the plugin will automatically record all players by default.
- **Flexible configuration**: You can set a whitelist and blacklist, as well as the recording path, etc., through the configuration file.
- **Anti-cheat support**: Adapted to [Themis Anti Cheat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/themis-anti-cheat-1-17-1-20-bedrock-support-paper-compatibility-free-optimized.90766/), it automatically records when suspicious players are found (Beta)

Currently, it only adapts to [Themis Anti Cheat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/themis-anti-cheat-1-17-1-20-bedrock-support-paper-compatibility-free-optimized.90766/). If you need to adapt more anti-cheat plugins, please open an issue to propose!

## Instructions for use

## Precautions

- This plugin can only run under the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.top/) server environment, and does not support other common Spigot and its downstream cores (such as Paper, Purpur, etc.).
- Please read and configure the `config.toml` file carefully before using the plugin to ensure that the plugin can run normally.
- Although there are currently no bug reports caused by reload, try not to use plugins like Plugman to hot reload this plugin, which may cause many unknown problems!
