## Warning

This plugin can only run on servers using the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.org/) core, it does not support other cores!

> The developer only guarantees that the **latest stable version** of the ISeeYou plugin can run normally on the **latest version** of the Leaves core, and does not maintain compatibility with older versions.

## Introduction

ISeeYou can use the Replay API provided by the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.org/) core to record every move of the player in `.mcpr` format.

### Features

- **Automatic recording**: No manual operation is required, the plugin will automatically record all players by default.
- **Flexible configuration**: You can set a whitelist and blacklist, as well as the recording path, etc., through the configuration file.
- **Anti-cheat support**: Adapted to various anti-cheat plugins, it automatically records when suspicious players are found.
- **Instant Replay**: With a command, you can trace back a period of time of gameplay footage and save it in `.mcpr` format to the server's disk.

### Tutorial

1. **Install the plugin**: Place the plugin file in the plugin directory of the Leaves server and restart the server.

2. **Configure settings**: Edit the `plugins/ISeeYou/config.toml` file and adjust the recording parameters and anti-cheat settings as needed.

## Config

```toml

# Configuration:
deleteTmpFileOnLoad = true # Delete temporary files on load.
pauseInsteadOfStopRecordingOnPlayerQuit = false # Pause recording instead of stopping when player quits.
recordPath = "replay/player/${name}@${uuid}" # Recording storage path template, supports ${name} and ${uuid} variables.
asyncSave = false # Async save recording
bStats = true

[pauseRecordingOnHighSpeed]
enabled = false  # Whether to enable pausing recording on high speed, which pauses recording when the player moves at high speeds.
threshold = 20.0  # Speed threshold to trigger pausing recording on high speed.

[filter]
checkBy = "name"  # Basis for blacklist/whitelist check, can be "name" or "uuid", default is "name", indicating player name.
recordMode = "blacklist"  # Recording mode, either blacklist or whitelist.
blacklist = []  # Blacklist, empty means no players are blocked.
whitelist = []  # Whitelist, empty means no players are recorded.

[clearOutdatedRecordFile]
enabled = false  # Whether to enable cleaning function.
interval = 24  # Cleaning interval (hours).
days = 7  # Number of days to retain outdated recording files.

[recordSuspiciousPlayer]
enableThemisIntegration = false  # Whether to enable recording of suspicious players monitored by Themis reports.
enableMatrixIntegration = false  # Whether to enable recording of suspicious players monitored by Matrix reports.
enableVulcanIntegration = false  # Whether to enable recording of suspicious players monitored by Vulcan reports.
enableNegativityIntegration = false  # Whether to enable recording of suspicious players monitored by Negativity reports.
enableGrimACIntegration = false  # Whether to enable recording of suspicious players monitored by GrimAC reports.
recordMinutes = 5  # Recording time for suspicious players (minutes).
recordPath = "replay/suspicious/${name}@${uuid}"  # Suspicious player recording file path template, supports ${name} and ${uuid} variables.

# [instantReplay] Instant replay settings
[instantReplay]
enabled = false  # Whether to enable instant replay functionality.
replayMinutes = 5  # Specifies how many minutes of gameplay can be traced back (minutes).
createMinutes = 1  # Specifies how often a camera is created (minutes).
recordPath = "replay/instant/${name}@${uuid}"  # Storage path template for instant replay recordings, supports ${name} and ${uuid} variables.
```

> Enabling instant replay, recording suspicious players, and other features may increase server performance consumption.

## Commands

> **`/photographer create <name>` and `/instantreplay` commands** can only be executed by players in the game, not in the server console.

> **`/photographer create <name> [location]` command** can be executed in the console.

> **Before using the `/instantreplay` command**, make sure that the corresponding feature is enabled in the plugin configuration file.

## Precautions

- This plugin can only run under the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.top/) server environment, and does not support other common Spigot and its downstream cores (such as Paper, Purpur, etc.).
- Please read and configure the `config.toml` file carefully before using the plugin to ensure that the plugin can run normally.
- Although there are currently no bug reports caused by reload, try not to use plugins like Plugman to hot reload this plugin, which may cause many unknown problems!
